Simple hangman game. Used arrays for word selection as well as for the individual letters of the chosen word. 
One array was filled with underscores equal to the length of the chosen word. That array is then filled with correct
letters at the appropriate spot if the user guesses correctly. Second array is used to track incorrect letters.
